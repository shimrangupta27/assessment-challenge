Business Intelligence Assignment

1) With Jio coming in, we have seen an influx of internet users from Tier 2 and Tier 3.
Video/Content apps like Youtube and Tiktok have seen a huge growth while
Amazon/Flipkart haven’t seen similar.
What could be the reason for it? Feel free to use any publicly available data to support
your hypotheses.

answer-> The possible reason for huge growth in video streaming apps (tiktok and YouTube ) can be :
1.A Nation with youth population: India as a nation holds a youth population and this youth population is usually studying in college or school. These youth who are also student used YouTube for their productive use that is they used to watch online study related content. Some used it to learn steps of dance, music or cooking tips.
2.Jio offering cheaper plan : when jio came it gave 4-5 month of free internet and calling as promotional stunt.Ever after that free time period, they offered internet as cheaper rate in comparison to existing plans of other network provider. Which again made people to use jio. And availability of 1.5 or 2gb Data per day made them use use for YouTube and tiktok.
Tiktok offered a platform to youth to show their talent and jio's cheap data offering made it possible.
.
As people were busing using tiktok and youtube, they rarely used shopping sites.
These whole scenario gave a growth to video content apps like YouTube and tiktok whereas same growth was Not seen in shopping sites like amazon and flipkart.


2) New Onboarding Design at Nymtra
Nymtra is India’s leading fashion app. The Product team revamped the app’s Onboarding
Flow on 31st July that introduced the following features:

shipping for the
first-order, and easy returns
● Added a ‘Skip Login’ option to the login screen at the end of the walkthrough
● Added a new “10,000+ items under ₹999” banner on the home screen.
You are attending the product review meeting on 5th November where the team looks at
the following data:

Question: Is the onboarding flow revamp a success? Justify.

answer-> From the table we can understand that after revamping the app
No. Of installs are increased every month from May to October, first time buyer and revenue from first time buyer is also showed a upward trend but if we see the first time buyer who made a secund purchase then we will find that it showed a downward trend which somehow shows those who purchased for first time not showed much interest in buying the product again, possible reason can be, they are not satisfied with product quality or there can be possibility of people facing problem in payment mechanism or apps interface.
 
Overall we can say that yes onboarding flow revamp a success.

3) Personalised Recommendations at FilmiStar
Part A:
FilmiStar is India’s #1 app for watching movies. The Product team was tasked with
designing a new carousel on the home screen that will show personalised movie
recommendations based on the user’s taste. Currently, the home screen shows trending
and new movies only.
Questions:
1) What will be the change in user behaviour once this feature is introduced?
2) What should be the goals and metrics for this feature?
3) How should this feature be launched and evaluated?

answer-> 1. Introduction of this feature can attrack user to watch movie and videos of their own taste whereas as it can annoy too, to those user who not like getting notified each and Everytime.
2. It should have simple goal that it never hamper the privacy of user and there should be a option to on/off these notification .
Before launching thus feature it should be evaluated by distributing the app to office staff, employee of the company. Once they let us know the possible improvement that we can do , then launching it would be better.
